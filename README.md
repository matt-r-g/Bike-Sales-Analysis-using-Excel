# Bike-Sales-Analysis-using-Excel 📊🚴‍♂️

Welcome to the **Bike Sales Analysis** project! In this project, I worked with a Bike Sales dataset and performed various data analysis tasks using **Excel**. The goal was to extract meaningful insights from the data to support business decisions.

## 📈 Project Overview

This project analyses the **Bike Sales** dataset, which contains details of sales transactions, bike models, sales amounts and commissions. I utilised Excel's powerful features to clean, transform and visualise the data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

In this project, I made use of several essential Excel functions and features to analyse the data:

- **SUM**: Summed up sales totals to analyse overall revenue.
- **AVERAGE**: Calculated average sales values for different bike models.
- **UNIQUE**: Identified unique bike models and sales representatives.
- **VLOOKUP**: Matched and retrieved information from different tables.
- **SUMIF & SUMIFS**: Used these functions to sum sales based on specific criteria.
- **Cell Referencing**: Applied absolute and relative references to make calculations dynamic.
- **Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts**: Created pivot tables to summarise data and pivot charts to visualise the trends.
- **Slicers**: Added slicers to filter and segment data dynamically.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Total Sales**: I created a "Total Sales" column to calculate the total revenue for each sale.
- **Commission Calculation**: I added a "Commission" column to calculate the commission for each salesperson based on predefined commission rules.
- **Data Visualisation**: Pivot tables and charts helped me visualise sales trends, identify top-performing bike models and understand seasonal variations.
